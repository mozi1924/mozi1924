## 🚀 The Intersection of Pixels and Logic

I’m **Mozi**, a 3D artist and developer based in Guiyang, China. I spend my time at the crossroads of creative storytelling and technical infrastructure. Whether I’m engineering complex rigs in Blender or architecting serverless applications, I’m driven by a single goal: **building tools and experiences that feel seamless.**

### What I Do

* **3D Generalist & Tool Developer:** Specializing in **Blender**, I create high-precision tracking workflows, photogrammetry-based compositing, and custom animation tools. I’m currently developing **Rig-2**, a next-gen Minecraft rig designed for professional-grade motion capture and flexibility.
* **Web Architect:** I build for the modern web using **Astro**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Cloudflare Workers**. I believe in the power of static-first, performance-driven sites that don't sacrifice interactivity.
* **Systems & Homelabbing:** When I’m not rendering, I’m managing my home lab. From **Proxmox** and **OPNsense** to experimenting with **NixOS**, I enjoy the challenge of maintaining robust, privacy-conscious digital environments.

### My Philosophy: "Build, Learn, Share"

I’ve always been a proponent of the "learn in public" mentality. That’s why I share my process through video tutorials and open-source Blender extensions. I believe the best way to master a craft is to teach it to others—breaking down complex concepts into digestible, actionable steps.

### Beyond the Screen

When the monitors are off, you can usually find me:

* **Traveling:** Capturing the urban energy of cities like Chongqing or the quiet coastlines of Hainan.
* **Audio Tinkering:** Exploring the possibilities of AI voice synthesis and audio production.
* **At Home:** Hanging out with my cat and fine-tuning my mining setups.
