## Introduction

Hello, this is Mozi1924! Today, we'll learn how to create a retro-styled Synthwave scene using Blender's Geometry Nodes. Transitioning from video to a illustrated tutorial, I hope to bring you a different reading experience. Don't forget to bookmark my website, mozi1924.com!

In this tutorial, we'll build this dynamic Synthwave world together:

## What are Geometry Nodes?

Geometry Nodes is a powerful tool built into Blender that allows you to generate and modify geometry using a node graph. You can combine various nodes like building blocks, using mathematical logic to create infinitely complex models—and everything is procedural, making later adjustments easy.

## What Will You Learn?

This tutorial will guide you through completing a full Synthwave scene, covering these core concepts:

-   Creating a base grid with the `Grid` node
-   Controlling grid shape with the `Set Position` node
-   Generating rolling hills using `Noise Texture`
-   Creating a straight highway with `Map Range`
-   Passing data to materials via `Store Named Attribute`
-   Understanding basic math and vector operations

In the material section, we'll also cover:

-   Creating glowing grid effects with `Wave Texture`
-   Controlling color and masks with `Color Ramp`
-   Mixing transparent materials with `Mix Shader`

Ready? Let's dive in!

## Building the Ground

### 1. Creating the Base Grid

Add a new plane to the scene (`Shift+A` → Mesh → Plane). Select it, then open the **Geometry Node Editor** and click `New` to create a new node tree.

By default, you'll see `Group Input` and `Group Output` nodes. Let's delete the `Group Input` node first. Then, add a `Grid` node and connect it to the `Group Output`.

![Add Grid node](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/5-add-grid-node.webp)

In the `Grid` node, set both `Size X/Y` to `200` and `Vertices X/Y` to `200` to get a sufficiently large grid ground.

### 2. Sculpting the Terrain

Next, add a `Set Position` node and place it between the `Grid` and `Group Output`. This node allows us to change the position of each vertex.

To control the height (Z-axis), we need a `Combine XYZ` node. Connect its output to the `Offset` input of the `Set Position` node.

![Combine XYZ node and Set Position node](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/8-combine-xyz-node-and-set-position-node.webp)

Now, add a `Noise Texture` node. Connect its `Fac` output to the Z input of the `Combine XYZ` node. You'll notice the ground becomes bumpy with noise—but it doesn't look like hills yet because the noise lacks positional information.

Connect the `UV Map` output from the `Grid` node to the `Vector` input of the `Noise Texture`. The noise immediately smooths out, forming natural hill contours.

![Grid node and Noise Texture node](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/11-grid-node-and-noise-texture-node.webp)

Now, use a `Math` (Multiply) node to amplify the noise intensity. For example, multiplying by `50` makes the hills prominently visible. You can adjust the noise parameters and the multiplication factor to your liking.

### 3. Animating the Ground Movement

To create a sense of the ground "moving forward," we need to make the UV coordinates change over time. Insert a `Vector Math` node between the `Grid` and the `Noise Texture`, setting its operation to `Add`.

![Vector Math node with Grid UV Map and Noise Texture](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/12-vector-math-node-and-grid-uv-map-node-and-noise-texture-node.webp)

Next, add a `Scene Time` node. Use a `Combine XYZ` node to apply its effect only on the Y-axis: connect the `Seconds` output of `Scene Time` to the Y input of this new `Combine XYZ`. Then, connect this `Combine XYZ` to the second input of the `Vector Math` node.

![Scene Time node and Combine XYZ node](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/14-scene-time-node-and-combine-xyz-node.webp)

Play the animation (Spacebar). The ground will now move in the positive Y direction. If it's too fast, insert a `Math` (Multiply) node in between to multiply the time by a smaller coefficient (e.g., `0.1`) to slow it down.

![Math node with Scene Time and Combine XYZ](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/15-math-node-and-scene-time-node-and-combine-xyz-node.webp)

Now that the ground has undulations and motion, let's carve out a straight highway for it.

## Building the Highway

The highway is essentially a depressed strip symmetrical along the X-axis. We'll generate this mask by separating the axes and applying mathematical operations.

Add a `Separate XYZ` node, feed the `Grid`'s UV Map into it, and extract the X-axis. Then:

-   First, use a `Math` (Subtract) node to subtract a value (e.g., `0`, to keep the center symmetrical).
-   Then, use a `Math` (Absolute) node to take the absolute value, making the values on both sides of the X-axis symmetrical.

![Separate XYZ node and Math nodes](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/16-separate-xyz-node-and-math-node.webp)

Use this symmetrical value as a coefficient for the height influence: Insert another `Math` (Multiply) node just before the values enter the `Combine XYZ` node (after the noise multiplication), and multiply the noise strength by this symmetrical value.

![Math nodes with Multiply and Combine XYZ](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/17-math-node-and-multiply-node-and-combine-xyz-node.webp)

You'll now see a thin depressed line appear in the center of the ground—the prototype of the highway. However, the line is too thin. We need a `Map Range` node to adjust its width and falloff.

Connect the `Map Range` node after the `Absolute` node. Adjust `From Min / Max` to control the range of the depression, and `To Min / Max` to control the intensity of the depression (usually kept at 0–1). For a smoother transition, change the interpolation type to `Smooth Step`.

![Map Range node with Absolute and Multiply nodes](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/18-map-range-node-and-absolute-node-and-multiply-node.webp)

Now, the highway's depression blends naturally with the hills on either side, and the effect looks quite good.

## Passing Data to Materials: Store Named Attribute

To allow the material to also read the moving coordinates of the ground (so the glowing grid moves along with it), we need to "store" the coordinate data within the geometry. This is done using the `Store Named Attribute` node.

Place it within the geometry data flow (for example, after the `Set Position` node). Set the data type to `Vector` and the attribute name to `v_pos` (or any name you prefer). Connect the coordinate output from our earlier `Vector Math` node to its `Value` input.

![Store Named Attribute node](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/19-store-named-attribute-node.webp)

This saves the final position of each vertex into the attribute `v_pos`, which can be accessed later by shader nodes.

The overall node tree should look something like this:

![Overall node tree](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/20-whole-node-tree.webp)

Don't forget to add a `Set Material` node at the end of your Geometry Node tree, pointing to the material we're about to create. Otherwise, the material won't be applied.

## Ground Material: The Glowing Grid

Switch to the **Shader Editor** and create a new material. Go back to the Geometry Nodes and assign this material to the ground using the `Set Material` node.

Now, let's build the material. Our goal is a glowing grid that conforms perfectly to the terrain's起伏.

1.  Add an `Attribute` node. Set the Type to `Geometry` and the Name to `v_pos` (the name we defined earlier). This gives us the final world coordinates of each vertex (after displacement and movement).
2.  Use two `Wave Texture` nodes to generate stripes in the X and Y directions:
    -   First: Bands Direction = `X`, Wave Profile = `Sine`
    -   Second: Bands Direction = `Y`, Wave Profile = `Sine`
    -   Use a `Value` node to control their `Scale` (e.g., 10), adjusting the grid density.

![Wave Texture nodes](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/24-wave-texture-node.webp)

3.  Connect each `Wave Texture` to a `Color Ramp`. Sharpen the gradient into distinct black and white stripes:
    -   Set the first color to pure black (position 0), the second color to pure white (position 0.02). Set the interpolation to `Constant`.
    -   This retains only a small segment around the wave peaks as white, turning the rest black, creating thin lines.

![Color Ramp nodes](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/25-color-ramp-node.webp)

4.  Multiply the outputs of the two `Color Ramp`s using a `Math` (Multiply) node. This gives us the intersecting grid pattern (the white parts are the grid lines).

![Current node tree](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/26-current-node-tree.webp)

5.  Add another `Color Ramp` to convert the multiplied result into a hard mask: set the first color to pure white, the second to pure black. Use Constant interpolation, and set the position of the second color to `0.5`. This makes areas brighter than 0.5 white (grid lines) and everything else black.

![Color Ramp node](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/27-color-ramp-node.webp)

6.  Create two `Emission` nodes. Set their colors to your preference (e.g., purple and magenta). Mix them using a `Mix Shader`, with the factor (`Fac`) driven by the mask from the previous step.

![Current node tree](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/28-current-node-tree.webp)

Finally, you'll see the glowing grid perfectly贴合 the ground's起伏 and moving along with it. Adjust the earlier `Value` node to change the grid density, and feel free to experiment with the colors of the two Emission shaders.

## Creating the Retro Sun

The iconic visual element of Synthwave—the louvered sunset—can be achieved with a simple sphere and a procedural material.

### 1. Basic Setup

Add a UV sphere to the scene (`Shift+A` → Mesh → UV Sphere). Right-click and choose Shade Smooth. Set the sphere's scale to `(50, 0.01, 50)`—squashing it on the Y-axis to form a flat disc, making the stripe effect easier to observe. Position it appropriately in the background of the scene.

![UV Sphere](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/30-uv-sphere.webp)

### 2. Material Concept

This material can be broken down into two parts: a vertical color gradient and horizontal transparent stripes.

### 3. Getting Coordinates and Separating Z

Create a new material. Add a `Texture Coordinate` node and use its **Object** output. Since we want the gradient based on the object's own Z-axis (up-down direction), using Object coordinates ensures that the Z-axis always points along the object's local up direction, regardless of rotation.

Add a `Separate XYZ` node and extract the Z-axis. At this point, the black-and-white gradient maps from bottom (black) to top (white).

![Texture Coordinate node](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/32-texture-coordinate-node.webp)

### 4. Creating the Color Gradient

Feed the Z-axis into a `Color Ramp`. Set two color stops:
-   Left side (bottom): Dark purple or black
-   Right side (top): Bright orange or yellow

Connect the `Color Ramp` output to an `Emission` node. Increase the strength slightly (e.g., 1.0~2.0) to make the sun glow.

![Color Ramp node](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/33-color-ramp-node.webp)

### 5. Math Combination: Making the Stripes

We need to turn the continuous Z-axis into间断的 stripes. This uses a classic series of math operations: **Multiply → Fraction → Compare**.

-   **Multiply**: Controls the stripe density. In the example, two branches are used, multiplying by slightly different values like `10.14` and `9.60`. This叠加 two slightly different frequencies, preventing the stripes from looking too rigid and creating more interesting detail.
-   **Fraction**: Takes the fractional part of the value, turning the continuous line into a repeating sawtooth wave.
-   **Greater Than**: Sets a threshold (e.g., 0.5). It binarizes the sawtooth wave: outputs 1 (white) where the value is greater than the threshold, otherwise 0 (black). Adjusting the threshold controls the stripe thickness.

Multiply the results of the two branches using a `Multiply` node to get the final stripe mask (white areas will be transparent, black areas will glow). Finally, you might use a `Less Than` node to invert the mask if needed, depending on how you want it to drive the `Mix Shader` factor (0=glow, 1=transparent).

![Math nodes](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/34-math-node.webp)

### 6. Mixing Transparency

Add a `Mix Shader` node:
-   Shader 1 input: Connect our finished `Emission` node.
-   Shader 2 input: Connect a `Transparent BSDF` node.
-   Fac input: Connect the output from the mathematical operations (the final mask).

![Mix Shader node](/assets/how-to-make-synthwave-in-blender/35-mix-shader-node.webp)

Now, where the factor is 0, the glowing sun is visible. Where the factor is 1, transparency is shown, effectively "cutting" stripes out of the sun and creating the classic louvered effect.

Feel free to adjust the colors, stripe density, and thickness to create your own unique retro sunset.

## Sky

In the Properties panel on the side, click on the World properties. Set the background color to a dark purple or any other color you like.
